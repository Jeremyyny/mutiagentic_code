{"task_id": "HumanEval/0", "completion": "To solve the problem efficiently, we need to determine if there are any two numbers in the list that have a difference less than or equal to the given threshold. A straightforward approach is to use nested loops to compare each pair of elements, but this would result in an \\(O(n^2)\\) time complexity. Instead, we can optimize by sorting the list first and then checking consecutive pairs, which reduces the time complexity to \\(O(n \\log n)\\).\n\nHere's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than\n    given threshold.\n    \n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)\n    False\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)\n    True\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the numbers to bring potential close elements next to each other\n    numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Iterate through the sorted list and check consecutive pairs\n    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):\n        if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1]) <= threshold:\n            return True\n    \n    return False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sorting**: We first sort the `numbers` list. Sorting helps bring elements that are close to each other next to one another, allowing us to only check consecutive pairs.\n\n2. **Checking Consecutive Pairs**: After sorting, we iterate through the list and compare each element with its immediate neighbor. If any pair has a difference less than or equal to `threshold`, we return `True`.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The time complexity is \\(O(n \\log n)\\) due to sorting, followed by an \\(O(n)\\) pass through the sorted list, making it efficient for large lists.\n\nThis solution efficiently determines if any two elements in the list are within the specified threshold of each other."}

Sets provide O(1) average-time complexity for lookups, making them efficient for checking membership.\n\n2. **Generator Expression**: We iterate over each character in the input string `text`. The generator expression `(char for char in text if char not in vowels)` yields only those characters that are not in the `vowels` set.\n\n3. **Joining Characters**: `''.join(...)` is used to concatenate the filtered characters into a single string, which is then returned as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input string and handles all test cases provided in the problem description."}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/52", "completion": "To complete the function `below_threshold`, we need to iterate over all elements in the list `l` and check if each element is below the threshold `t`.

If so, it immediately returns `False`, as this means at least one number does not satisfy the condition of being below the threshold.\n- If the loop completes without finding any such number, it returns `True` indicating all numbers are indeed below the threshold.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it stops checking as soon as it finds a number that fails the condition, making it potentially faster than iterating through the entire list unnecessarily."}

If so, it's counted as an additional vowel since it's at the end of the word.\n\n5. **Test Cases:** The provided test cases demonstrate how this function works with different inputs, including edge cases like words ending in 'y'.\n\nThis implementation efficiently handles both regular and special cases for counting vowels in a given string."}

If no such combination is found after checking all possibilities, return `False`.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\ndef is_multiply_prime(a):\n    \"\"\"Returns True if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and false otherwise.\n    \n    Example:\n    is_multiply_prime(30) == True\n    30 = 2 * 3 * 5\n    \"\"\"\n    def sieve_of_eratosthenes(max_num):\n        \"\"\"Generate a list of primes up to max_num using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.\"\"\"\n        is_prime = [True] * (max_num + 1)\n        p = 2\n        while (p * p <= max_num):\n            if is_prime[p]:\n                for i in range(p * p, max_num + 1, p):\n                    is_prime[i] = False\n            p += 1\n        return [p for p in range(2, max_num + 1) if is_prime[p]]\n\n    # Generate all primes less than 100\n    primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(99)\n\n    # Check combinations of three primes\n    from itertools import combinations_with_replacement\n\n    for combo in combinations_with_replacement(primes, 3):\n        if combo[0] * combo[1] * combo[2] == a:\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\n# Example usage\nprint(is_multiply_prime(30))  # Output: True\nprint(is_multiply_prime(42))  # Output: True (2 * 3 * 7)\nprint(is_multiply_prime(50))  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: This function generates all prime numbers up to a specified limit (`max_num`). It initializes a boolean list `is_prime` where each index represents whether the number is prime.\n\n- **Combinations with Replacement**: We use `combinations_with_replacement` from `itertools` to consider combinations of three primes, allowing repetition (e.g., \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 3\\)).\n\n- **Efficiency**: Since `a` is less than 100, the number of primes and combinations is small enough to make this approach efficient. The sieve runs in \\(O(n \\log \\log n)\\) time, and checking combinations is manageable due to the limited range.\n\nThis solution efficiently checks all possible ways to express `a` as a product of three primes within the given constraints."}

For example, 'a' becomes 'e', 'b' becomes 'f', etc.\n\n2. **Handle Wrapping Around**: The rotation must wrap around at the end of the alphabet.

This pattern matches any of '.', '?', or '!' followed by zero or more spaces (`\\s*`), which handles cases where there might be a space after punctuation.\n  \n- **Trimming and Checking**: After splitting, each sentence fragment is trimmed of whitespace with `strip()`. We then check if it starts with \"I \". The space ensures we don't mistakenly count words like \"In\" as starting with \"I\".\n\n- **Counting**: A counter (`boredom_count`) keeps track of how many sentences start with \"I\". \n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input string and correctly identifies sentences that qualify as \"boredoms\"."}

This is more efficient than iterating through each number and adding them up.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Indices**: We need to iterate over indices starting from 1 to `n`, inclusive, and apply the appropriate calculation based on whether the index is even or odd.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef f(n):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            # Calculate factorial of i\n            factorial = 1\n            for j in range(1, i + 1):\n                factorial *= j\n            result.append(factorial)\n        else:\n            # Calculate sum from 1 to i\n            total_sum = (i * (i + 1)) // 2\n            result.append(total_sum)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nprint(f(5))  # Output: [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We initialize an empty list `result` to store the results.\n- We loop over each index `i` from 1 to `n`.\n- For even indices (`i % 2 == 0`), we calculate the factorial by initializing a variable `factorial` to 1 and multiplying it with every number from 1 to `i`. The result is appended to the list.\n- For odd indices, we use the formula `(i * (i + 1)) // 2` to compute the sum of numbers from 1 to `i`, which is then appended to the list.\n- Finally, we return the `result` list containing all computed values."}

{"task_id": "HumanEval/119", "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there is a way to concatenate two strings of parentheses such that the resulting string has balanced parentheses. A string with balanced parentheses means every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')' and they are correctly nested.\n\nHere's how we can approach solving the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have two strings, each consisting only of '(' or ')'. We need to check if there is an order in which concatenating these two strings results in a balanced parentheses string.\n\n2. **Balanced Parentheses Check**: A string is considered balanced if at any point from left to right:\n   - The number of ')' does not exceed the number of '(', and\n   - At the end, the total number of '(' equals the total number of ')'.\n\n3. **Concatenation Orders**: Since we have two strings, there are only two possible concatenations:\n   - Concatenate `lst[0]` with `lst[1]`\n   - Concatenate `lst[1]` with `lst[0]`\n\n4. **Check Both Orders**: For each order of concatenation, check if the resulting string is balanced.\n\n5. **Implementation**: Implement a helper function to determine if a given string has balanced parentheses.

This ensures that the heap always contains the largest `k` elements seen so far.\n\n4. **Final Sorting**: Once all elements have been processed, the heap will contain the largest `k` numbers in an unsorted order.

Additionally, since we are adding four even numbers (each contributing an even amount), the sum will always be even.

If multiple strings have maximum number of unique\n    characters, return the one which comes first in lexicographical order.\n\n    find_max([\"name\", \"of\", \"string\"]) == \"string\"\n    find_max([\"name\", \"enam\", \"game\"]) == \"enam\"\n    find_max([\"aaaaaaa\", \"bb\" ,\"cc\"]) == \"aaaaaaa\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize variables to keep track of the best word found\n    max_unique_count = 0\n    result_word = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words:\n        # Calculate the number of unique characters in the current word\n        unique_chars = len(set(word))\n        \n        # Check if this word has more unique characters than the current maximum\n        if unique_chars > max_unique_count:\n            max_unique_count = unique_chars\n            result_word = word\n        \n        # If it's a tie on the number of unique characters, check lexicographical order\n        elif unique_chars == max_unique_count:\n            if word < result_word:\n                result_word = word\n    \n    return result_word\n\n# Example usage\nprint(find_max([\"name\", \"of\", \"string\"]))  # Output: \"string\"\nprint(find_max([\"name\", \"enam\", \"game\"]))  # Output: \"enam\"\nprint(find_max([\"aaaaaaa\", \"bb\" ,\"cc\"]))   # Output: \"aaaaaaa\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `max_unique_count` to zero and `result_word` to an empty string.\n\n2. **Iteration**: For each word in the list, we calculate the number of unique characters using `len(set(word))`.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - If the current word has more unique characters than any previously checked words (`unique_chars > max_unique_count`), update both `max_unique_count` and `result_word`.\n   - If it ties with the maximum unique character count, check lexicographical order using `<`. Update `result_word` if the current word is smaller.\n\n4. **Return**: After iterating through all words, return the `result_word`, which will be the word with the maximum number of unique characters and lexicographically smallest among those.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the desired word in a single pass through the list."}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/159", "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more carrots the rabbit can eat given its current needs and the number of remaining carrots. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Determine How Many Carrots the Rabbit Can Actually Eat**: \n   - The rabbit wants to eat `need` more carrots, but it only has `remaining` carrots available.\n   - Therefore, the actual number of carrots the rabbit can eat is the minimum between `need` and `remaining`.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Carrots Eaten**:\n   - Add the number of additional carrots eaten (from step 1) to the `number` of carrots already eaten.\n\n3. **Calculate Remaining Carrots**:\n   - Subtract the actual number of carrots eaten from the `remaining` carrots to find out how many are left after the rabbit finishes eating.\n\n4. **Return the Results**:\n   - Return a list containing the total number of carrots eaten and the number of remaining carrots.\n\nHere's the completed function:\n\n```python\ndef eat(number, need, remaining):\n    # Calculate how many more carrots the rabbit can actually eat\n    actual_eaten = min(need, remaining)\n    \n    # Total number of carrots eaten after this meal\n    total_eaten = number + actual_eaten\n    \n    # Number of carrots left after eating\n    leftover_carrots = remaining - actual_eaten\n    \n    return [total_eaten, leftover_carrots]\n\n# Example test cases\nprint(eat(5, 6, 10))  # Output: [11, 4]\nprint(eat(4, 8, 9))   # Output: [12, 1]\nprint(eat(1, 10, 10)) # Output: [11, 0]\nprint(eat(2, 11, 5))  # Output: [7, 0]\n```\n\nThis function efficiently computes the desired results by considering the constraints and conditions provided in the problem description."}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/160", "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to evaluate an arithmetic expression given two lists: `operator` and `operand`. The `operator` list contains the operations to be performed between consecutive elements of the `operand` list. The challenge is to respect the order of operations (also known as operator precedence) when evaluating the expression.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef do_algebra(operators, operands):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two lists operators and operands, build and evaluate the algebraic expression.\n    \n    :param operators: A list of strings representing operators ('+', '-', '*', '//', '**')\n    :param operands: A list of non-negative integers\n    :return: The result of evaluating the algebraic expression\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define operator precedence\n    precedence = {'+': 1, '-': 1, '*': 2, '//': 2, '**': 3}\n    \n    # Helper function to apply an operation on two numbers\n    def apply_operator(op, a, b):\n        if op == '+':\n            return a + b\n        elif op == '-':\n            return a - b\n        elif op == '*':\n            return a * b\n        elif op == '//':\n            return a // b\n        elif op == '**':\n            return a ** b\n    \n    # Convert the expression to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) using the Shunting Yard algorithm\n    output = []\n    operators_stack = []\n    \n    for i in range(len(operands)):\n        # Add the current operand to the output list\n        output.append(operands[i])\n        \n        if i < len(operators):\n            op = operators[i]\n            \n            # While there's an operator on the stack with greater or equal precedence, pop it to the output\n            while (operators_stack and \n                   precedence[operators_stack[-1]] >= precedence[op]):\n                output.append(operators_stack.pop())\n            \n            # Push the current operator onto the stack\n            operators_stack.append(op)\n    \n    # Pop all the remaining operators from the stack to the output list\n    while operators_stack:\n        output.append(operators_stack.pop())\n    \n    # Evaluate the RPN expression\n    evaluation_stack = []\n    \n    for token in output:\n        if isinstance(token, int):\n            evaluation_stack.append(token)\n        else:\n            b = evaluation_stack.pop()\n            a = evaluation_stack.pop()\n            result = apply_operator(token, a, b)\n            evaluation_stack.append(result)\n    \n    # The final result will be the only item left in the evaluation stack\n    return evaluation_stack[0]\n\n# Example usage:\noperators = ['+', '*', '-']\noperands = [2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = do_algebra(operators, operands)  # Should output 9\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Operator Precedence**: We define a dictionary `precedence` to specify the precedence of each operator.\n\n2. **Shunting Yard Algorithm**: This algorithm is used to convert the infix expression (given by operators and operands) into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which makes it easier to evaluate while respecting operator precedence.\n\n3. **Evaluation**: Once we have the RPN, we can evaluate it using a stack-based approach:\n   - Numbers are pushed onto the stack.\n   - When an operator is encountered, two numbers are popped from the stack, the operation is applied, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.\n\n4. **Result**: The final value in the evaluation stack after processing all tokens is the result of the expression.\n\nThis approach ensures that operations are performed according to their precedence, providing the correct result for any valid input as specified by the problem description."}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/161", "completion": "To complete the given problem, we need to implement a function `solve(s)` that performs specific operations based on whether characters in the input string `s` are letters or not. Here's how we can achieve this efficiently:\n\n1. **Check if there are any letters** in the string.\n2. If no letters are found, simply reverse the entire string.\n3. If there are letters, iterate over each character:\n   - If it is a letter, swap its case (lower to upper or vice versa).\n   - Otherwise, keep the character unchanged.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef solve(s):\n    # Check if there are any letters in the string\n    has_letter = any(c.isalpha() for c in s)\n    \n    if not has_letter:\n        # If no letters, return the reversed string\n        return s[::-1]\n    \n    # If there are letters, process each character\n    result = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            # Swap case of the letter\n            result.append(char.swapcase())\n        else:\n            # Keep non-letter characters as they are\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Examples to test the function\nprint(solve(\"1234\"))  # Output: \"4321\"\nprint(solve(\"ab\"))    # Output: \"AB\"\nprint(solve(\"#a@C\"))  # Output: \"#A@c\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`any(c.isalpha() for c in s)`**: This checks if there is at least one letter in the string `s`. It returns `True` if any character is a letter, otherwise `False`.\n  \n- **`if not has_letter:`**: If no letters are present, we return the reversed string using slicing (`s[::-1]`).\n\n- **Iterating over each character**:\n  - Use `char.isalpha()` to check if a character is a letter.\n  - Use `char.swapcase()` to change the case of letters.\n  - Non-letter characters remain unchanged.\n\nThis solution efficiently processes the input string in linear time, making it suitable for strings of reasonable length."}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/162", "completion": "To complete the `string_to_md5` function, we can use Python's built-in `hashlib` library to compute the MD5 hash of a given string.

This is necessary because hashing functions work on byte data.\n4. **Create MD5 Hash Object:** Use `hashlib.md5()` to create an MD5 hash object with the encoded text.\n5. **Get Hexadecimal Digest:** Call `.hexdigest()` on the hash object to obtain a string of the hexadecimal representation of the hash.\n\nThis implementation is both correct and efficient for converting strings to their MD5 hash equivalents in Python."}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/163", "completion": "To solve the problem of generating even digits between two given integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we need to consider a few key points:\n\n1. **Even Digits**: The even digits are [0, 2, 4, 6, 8].\n2. **Range Handling**: We need to handle both cases where \\(a \\leq b\\) and \\(a > b\\).\n3. **Order**: The result should always be in ascending order.\n4. **Inclusion of Digits**: Since we are dealing with digits, the range is effectively from 0 to 9.\n\nGiven these considerations, here's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n    \n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the set of even digits\n    even_digits = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}\n    \n    # Determine the actual range based on a and b\n    start = min(a, b)\n    end = max(a, b)\n    \n    # Find even digits within the specified range\n    result = [digit for digit in even_digits if start <= digit < end]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(generate_integers(2, 8))  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\nprint(generate_integers(8, 2))  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\nprint(generate_integers(10, 14))  # Output: []\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Even Digits Set**: We use a set to store the even digits for quick lookup and iteration.\n  \n- **Range Calculation**: By using `min(a, b)` and `max(a, b)`, we ensure that the function works regardless of whether \\(a\\) is less than or greater than \\(b\\).\n\n- **List Comprehension**: We use a list comprehension to filter out even digits within the specified range.
