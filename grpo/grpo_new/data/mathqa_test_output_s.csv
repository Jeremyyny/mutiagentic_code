2025-07-28T22:04:28.469847,1,problem_understanding,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller, manageable steps.

Step 1: Understanding the initial conditions
The shopkeeper sold an article with a 5% discount and still earned a profit of 31.1%. This means that the selling price was 5% less than the marked price (the price without the discount).

Step 2: Setting up the equations
Let's denote the cost price (CP) of the article as x. 
Let's denote the marked price (MP) of the article as y. 
We know that the shopkeeper sold the article with a 5% discount, which means the selling price (SP) is 95% of the marked price. So, SP = 0.95y.

Step 3: Relating the selling price to profit
The profit earned by the shopkeeper is 31.1% of the cost price. Therefore, SP - CP = 0.311x.

Step 4: Substituting the values
Now we can substitute the value of SP and CP in the equation: 0.95y - x = 0.311x.

Step 5: Simplifying the equation
Rearranging the terms, we get: 0.95y = 1.311x.

Step 6: Finding the profit percentage without the discount
To find the profit percentage without the discount, we need to find the relationship between the selling price and the cost price. Let's denote the selling price without the discount as SP' and the profit percentage without the discount as P'.

Using the previous equation: y = (1.311x) / 0.95 = 1.3905x.

Now, we can calculate the profit percentage without the discount: P' = ((SP' - x) / x) * 100.

Since we know that SP' = y, we can substitute the value of y in the equation: P' = (((1.3905x) - x) / x) * 100.

Simplifying further: P' = (0.3905x / x) * 100 = 39.05%.

Therefore, if no discount had been offered, the percentage of profit earned would have been approximately 39.05%.
",mathematical_formulation,"To solve the problem using a mathematical approach, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the given information:
- Discount offered: 5%
- Profit earned with discount: 31.1%

2. Define variables:
- Let x be the cost price (CP) of the article.
- Let y be the marked price (MP) of the article.

3. Translate the problem into mathematical equations:
- The selling price (SP) with the discount is 95% of the marked price. So, SP = 0.95y.
- The profit earned with the discount is 31.1% of the cost price. So, SP - CP = 0.311x.
- Substitute the value of SP from step 3 into the equation in step 2. We get 0.95y - x = 0.311x.

4. Solve the equation to find the relationship between the selling price and cost price:
- Rearrange the equation from step 3 to get 0.95y = 1.311x.
- Divide both sides by 1.311 to isolate y, which represents the selling price without discount. We get y = (1.311/0.95)x.
- Simplify the equation to get y ≈ 1.3905x.

5. Calculate the profit percentage without the discount:
- The profit percentage without the discount (P') can be calculated using the formula P' = ((SP' - CP) / CP) * 100, where SP' is the selling price without discount and CP is the cost price.
- Substitute the value of y (SP') and x (CP) into the formula. We get P' = ((1.3905x - x) / x) * 100.
- Simplify the equation to get P' = (0.3905x / x) * 100.
- Solve for P' to get P' ≈ 39.05%.

Therefore, if no discount had been offered, the percentage of profit earned would have been approximately 39.05%.",computation,"To solve this problem, we need to first understand the relationship between the cost price, the selling price, and the discount.

Let's denote:
CP: Cost price of the article
SP: Selling price of the article after discount
D: Discount percentage (5% in this case)
P: Profit percentage (31.1% in this case)

We know that:
SP = CP + P * CP
SP = CP * (1 + P/100)

Now, we also know that the selling price after the discount is given by:
SP = CP * (1 - D/100)

By equating the two expressions for SP, we get:
CP * (1 + P/100) = CP * (1 - D/100)

Simplifying the equation:
1 + P/100 = 1 - D/100

Now, let's solve for P:
P/100 = 1 - 1 - D/100
P = 100 * (1 - D/100)

Substituting the given values:
P = 100 * (1 - 5/100)
P = 100 * (0.95)
P = 95

Therefore, if no discount had been offered, the percentage of profit earned would have been approximately 95%.",computation,"Sure, I'll perform the computation for you. To find the percentage of profit earned if no discount had been offered, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Let's denote the cost price (CP) of the article as x.

Step 3: The profit earned with the discount is given as 31.1% of the cost price. So, SP - CP = 0.311x.
Step 4: Substitute the value of SP from Step 2 into the equation in Step 3. We get 0.95y - x = 0.311x.
Step 5: Rearrange the equation in Step 4 to solve for y in terms of x. We get y = (1.311x) / 0.95 = 1.3905x.

Step 7: We can calculate P' using the formula P' = ((SP' - CP) / CP) * 100, where SP' is the selling price without discount and CP is the cost price.
Step 8: Substitute the value of y (SP') and x (CP) into the formula in Step 7. We get P' = ((1.3905x - x) / x) * 100.
Step 9: Simplify the equation to get P' = (0.3905x / x) * 100.
Step 10: Solve for P' to get P' ≈ 39.05%.

Therefore, if no discount had been offered, the percentage of profit earned would have been approximately 39.05%.",computation,"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem statement and apply the correct mathematical method to find the percentage of profit if no discount had been offered.

MP: Marked price of the article
SP: Selling price of the article with the discount
D: Discount percentage (5% in this case)
P: Profit percentage (31.1% in this case)

Step 1: Translate the problem into mathematical equations.
We are given that the shopkeeper earned a profit of 31.1% with a 5% discount. This can be translated into the equation:
SP - CP = 0.311 * CP

Step 2: Express the selling price with the discount in terms of the marked price.
The selling price with the discount is given by:
SP = MP * (1 - D/100)
Substituting the given values, we have:
SP = MP * (1 - 5/100)
SP = MP * 0.95

Step 3: Substitute the expression for SP in the profit equation.
Substituting the expression for SP from Step 2 into the profit equation from Step 1, we get:
MP * 0.95 - CP = 0.311 * CP

Step 4: Solve for the relationship between the marked price and cost price.
Rearrange the equation to get:
MP * 0.95 = 1.311 * CP
MP = (1.311 * CP) / 0.95

Step 5: Calculate the profit percentage without the discount.
To calculate the profit percentage without the discount, we need to find the relationship between the selling price and cost price without considering the discount. We can do this by substituting the expression for MP from Step 4 into the formula for profit percentage:
Profit percentage (P') = ((SP' - CP) / CP) * 100
Substituting the expression for MP from Step 4 into the formula above, we get:
Profit percentage (P') = (((MP * 0.95) - CP) / CP) * 100
Substituting the value of MP from Step 4 into the equation above, we get:
Profit percentage (P') = (((((1.311 * CP) / 0.95) * 0.95) - CP) / CP) * 100
Simplifying the equation, we get:
Profit percentage (P') = ((1.311 * CP - CP) / CP) * 100
Simplifying further, we get:
Profit percentage (P') = (0.311 * CP / CP) * 100
Canceling out the CP, we get:

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the requirements and constraints:

1. There are 28 stations between Hyderabad and Bangalore.
2. A passenger can travel from any station to any other station.
3. We need to find the number of second class tickets that need to be printed.

Given this information, we can break down the problem into smaller components:

a) The number of stations between Hyderabad and Bangalore: 28
b) The number of possible combinations of stations for one-way travel: 28C1 (since there are 28 stations, a passenger can choose any one of them as the starting station)
c) The number of possible combinations of stations for two-way travel: 28C2 (since a passenger can choose any two stations as the starting and ending stations)

To find the total number of second class tickets that need to be printed, we add the number of one-way and two-way combinations:

Total tickets = 28C1 + 28C2

By understanding these components, we can proceed to the next step of solving the problem using mathematical formulation or computation.
",mathematical_formulation,"mathematical_formulation

To translate the problem into a solvable mathematical equation, we can consider the following steps:

1. Identify the number of stations between Hyderabad and Bangalore. Let's represent it with the variable ""n"". In this case, n = 28.

2. Determine the number of possible one-way travel combinations. Since a passenger can choose any one station as the starting station, the number of one-way combinations is nC1, where nC1 is the number of ways to choose 1 element from a set of n elements.

3. Determine the number of possible two-way travel combinations. Since a passenger can choose any two stations as the starting and ending stations, the number of two-way combinations is nC2, where nC2 is the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of n elements.

4. Add the number of one-way and two-way combinations to get the total number of second class tickets that need to be printed. The total number of tickets is 28C1 + 28C2.

So, the mathematical formulation for this problem can be expressed as:
Total tickets = nC1 + nC2",computation,"I will use the formula n(n-1)/2 to calculate the number of tickets.

First, let's represent the number of stations as n. In this case, n = 28.

Now, we can plug in the value of n into the formula:

Number of tickets = 28(28-1)/2 = 28*27/2 = 14*27 = 378

Therefore, 378 second class tickets need to be printed, so that a passenger can travel from any station to any other station.",mathematical_formulation,"mathematical_formulation

The problem can be formulated as a combinatorial problem. We need to find the total number of second class tickets that need to be printed, where a passenger can travel from any station to any other station.

To do this, we can use the concept of a complete graph. A complete graph is a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. In this case, the vertices represent the stations, and the edges represent the possible travel combinations.

The total number of second class tickets can be calculated as the number of edges in a complete graph with 28 vertices. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose 2 stations out of 28, which can be represented as:

Number of tickets = 28C2

This formula calculates the number of unique pairs of stations (edges) in a complete graph with 28 vertices.",computation,"Computation

To find the total number of second class tickets that need to be printed, we can use the formula for combinations: nCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

Given:
n = 28 (number of stations)

Let's compute the value of nC2:

Number of tickets = nC2 = 28! / (2!(28-2)!)

To simplify the calculation, we can use the formula for combinations of n items taken k at a time:

nCk = n * (n-1) / 2
